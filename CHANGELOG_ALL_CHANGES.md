### [3.5.6] - 2026-09-15

Fixed a data-loss bug affecting every installation upgrading from a pre-3.5 version, found and verified via a live v2.8.x→3.5.x upgrade on real hardware.

#### Fixed
- **Lifetime total counters reset to zero (or just the configured offset) across the v2.8.x→3.5.x upgrade**: `LambdaCounterSensor._restored_value()` (`sensor.py`) only ever tried Home Assistant's native restore (`RestoreSensor` extra data, then the entity's plain last state). An old integration version's entities go `unavailable` while its config entry unloads for the upgrade — exactly the moment a new version's entities try to restore from them — and `float("unavailable")` failed with no further fallback, silently starting every `_total` counter (`heating_energy_total`, `heating_thermal_energy_total`, `hot_water_energy_total`, `stby_energy_total`, and the cycling-count equivalents) over from `0.0`. `_restored_value()` now falls back to `homeassistant.components.recorder.statistics.get_last_statistics()`: since these are `state_class: TOTAL`/`TOTAL_INCREASING` sensors, Home Assistant already keeps long-term statistics for them, compiled from real values only — the last one still holds what the counter actually was, even across an `unavailable` gap in the plain state history.
- **A value recovered this way could get its configured offset added a second time**: `_applied_offset` (the amount of the configured `energy_consumption_offsets`/`cycling_offsets` already baked into a restored value) used to be read unconditionally from the last state's `applied_offset` attribute — which, like the state itself, is gone when that state was `"unavailable"`. `async_added_to_hass()` now treats a value recovered via the new statistics fallback as already including today's configured offset, so `_apply_offset()`'s delta calculation comes out to zero instead of re-applying the full offset on top.
- **A second, unrelated crash in the same change**: `YesterdayCycleSensor` (the `*_cycling_yesterday` sensors) calls the same `_restored_value()` helper, but its caller was not updated for the new return type (`_Restored`, carrying both the value and whether the source can be trusted for the offset attribute) — it kept assigning the whole object to `self._value`, and `round()`-ing a non-numeric object raised `TypeError: type _Restored doesn't define __round__ method` on every restore and again on every subsequent coordinator update, crashing entity setup and leaving these five sensors `unavailable`. Fixed to unwrap `.value` like the other caller.
- `manifest.json`: added `after_dependencies: ["recorder"]` (soft dependency — the platform starts after `recorder` when it is present, without requiring it).

#### Tests
- Added `tests/test_migration_restore.py::test_a_restart_from_unavailable_restores_from_statistics`: uses `pytest_homeassistant_custom_component`'s `recorder_mock` fixture plus `async_import_statistics()` to reproduce the exact failure — a mocked `"unavailable"` last state with no `RestoreSensor` extra data, and a long-term statistic holding the real prior value and a configured offset — and asserts the counter restores that value with the offset applied exactly once. Kept in its own file: `recorder_mock` has to resolve before `hass` does in this test harness, which conflicts with the module-wide `enable_custom_integrations` mark the other test files use.
- Added `tests/test_counters.py::test_yesterday_survives_a_restart`, covering the second bug directly (a plain restored state, no recorder involved) — reproduces the `TypeError` before the fix and passes after it.
- Full suite: 146/146 passing.
- **Verified live against real hardware** (installation `.115`, firmware `V0.0.9-3K`, upgrading from v2.8.x): captured a full before/after snapshot of all 177 `lambda_heat_pumps` entities via the ha-mcp API. Every lifetime and cycling total (`heating_energy_total`, `heating_thermal_energy_total`, `hot_water_energy_total`, `stby_energy_total`, and all five cycling totals, five of them with real configured offsets between 3.1 and 1500) survived the actual upgrade with its exact prior value and its offset applied exactly once. The `_cycling_yesterday` crash was reproduced live first (confirming the log signature above), then resolved by redeploying the fix and restarting again — no code regression this time, and the five previously-crashing sensors came back healthy.

### [3.5.5] - 2026-09-12

Fixed a register conflict reported for firmware 3+ controllers ([Issue #112](https://github.com/GuidoJeuken-6512/lambda_heat_pumps/issues/112)).

#### Fixed
- **Heating-circuit register 7 was modelled by two sensors with overlapping firmware ranges**: from firmware 3 on, the controller repurposes this address from the writable setpoint request (`flow_line_temperature_setpoint`) to the read-only value the controller actually acts on (`target_temp_flow_line`, added with `firmware_version=3`). `flow_line_temperature_setpoint` had no upper firmware bound, so on firmware 3+ both sensors were created against the same register — the reporter observed `flow_line_temperature_setpoint` showing no values there. `flow_line_temperature_setpoint` is now restricted to `firmware_versions=("1-2",)`, matching the reporter's own suggested fix and the range on which the register still means what its name says.

#### Tests
- Added `test_a_register_that_changed_meaning_is_not_double_modelled` in `tests/test_init.py`, covering both sides of the boundary: on `V0.0.8-3K` (firmware 6, past the repurposing) only `target_temp_flow_line` is created for HC1; on `V0.0.4-3K` (firmware 2, before it) only `flow_line_temperature_setpoint` is created — modelled after the existing `test_a_register_its_firmware_withdrew_is_not_modelled`.

### [3.5.4] - 2026-09-09

Fixed a second Home Assistant deprecation warning, surfaced by auditing the real system log of two live installations after a Home Assistant 2026.9.1 upgrade.

#### Fixed
- **`device_registry.async_get_device()` is deprecated, scheduled for removal in Home Assistant 2027.8.0**: `LambdaCoordinator.device_info()` used the identifiers-set lookup (`async_get_device(identifiers={controller})`) to find the controller device and set a sub-device's `via_device_id`. Home Assistant 2026.9 warns that device identifiers are no longer guaranteed unique across config entries and directs callers to `async_get_device_by_identifier()`, `async_get_device_by_connection()`, or `async_get_devices()` instead. Switched to `async_get_device_by_identifier(controller, entry.entry_id)`, which scopes the lookup to this config entry and so cannot be ambiguous — the same fix as the `via_device` deprecation resolved in 3.5.2 for the same underlying reason.

#### Tests
- Verified against real hardware on both live installations: the full suite (143 tests) passes unchanged; a live remove-and-recreate of the config entry (delete the entry, its devices and entities from storage, restart, recreate the entry, restart again) reproduces the identical 156 entities across 4 devices, with `via_device_id` correctly resolved on all three sub-devices; and a full end-to-end run of the actual config flow (`async_step_user` → `async_can_connect` → `async_create_entry` → `async_setup_entry`, including the real module auto-detection) against the real controller registers the same 156 entities and leaves the entry `LOADED`.

### [3.5.3] - 2026-09-06

Fixed a functional regression from 3.5.0 found via live testing against real hardware: every Modbus write used the wrong function code.

#### Fixed
- **Every Modbus write used FC06 (Write Single Register) for a single-register write; Lambda's own Modbus documentation mandates FC16 (Write Multiple Registers) for every write and does not implement FC06 at all** — it answers FC06 with Illegal Function (exception 0x01). This made every write-capable feature fail, logged or silent depending on the path: room-thermostat control (register 5004, logged every ~9s), PV-surplus export, the hot-water/heating-circuit/cooling-circuit setpoints, the flow-line offset, and the generic `write_modbus_register` service. The pre-3.5 `pymodbus`-based code never hit this, because it always wrote through `write_registers()` (FC16), even for a single register. Every `writable=True` field in `lambda_modbus/` now sets `force_fc16=True` (a flag `modbus-connection` provides for exactly this case), and the two call sites that wrote directly (`services.py`'s PV-surplus writer and the generic register-write service) now call `write_registers()` instead of `write_register()`.
- Verified live against real hardware (firmware `V0.0.8-3K`): the room-temperature write (register 5004) and a hot-water setpoint change via `climate.set_temperature` both landed correctly after the fix; before it, both failed with `Modbus Exception 0x01 for function code 0x06`.

#### Note
- No `PackedBitsField`/bit-field register exists in the current model, so the one FC06-only path inside `modbus-connection`'s `write_register_field()` (used for read-modify-write of packed bit registers, which ignores `force_fc16`) never applies here.

### [3.5.2] - 2026-09-06

Follow-up to 3.5.0: three gaps found while auditing every 2.7.x/2.8.x bugfix made on the pre-rewrite `main` branch against the rewritten codebase, to see which still applied.

#### Fixed
- **`via_device` deprecation warning on sub-devices**: `LambdaCoordinator.device_info()` still passed the legacy `via_device` (identifiers-tuple) kwarg, logging a Home Assistant removal warning (targeted for 2027.8.0) on every setup. Since 3.x requires Home Assistant ≥ 2026.9 unconditionally, it now always resolves and passes `via_device_id` (the parent device's registry id) instead — unlike the 2.8.5 fix on `main`, no HA-version gate is needed here.
- **0xFFFF ("no request"/"no external sensor") read as a real value**: the outside-air temperature (no external ambient sensor connected) and a buffer's request registers (no active request) report `0xFFFF` (-1) instead of a measurement — scaled, that looked like a plausible reading (e.g. exactly -300.0 °C) instead of `unknown`. This sentinel is now filtered on the affected fields (`Ambient.temperature`, `Buffer.request_type`/`request_flow_line_temp_setpoint`/`request_return_line_temp_setpoint`/`request_heat_sink_temp_diff_setpoint`/`modbus_request_heating_capacity`, `HeatingCircuit.operating_mode`) — global sentinel filtering was left untouched, since -1 is a genuine value on other registers (e.g. temperature offsets).
- **Modbus reads and writes were not actually serialized**: `modbus-connection`'s own request-pacing lock only activates when a nonzero `message_spacing`/`unit_spacing` is configured on the connection — with neither set (the default), it is a no-op. The poll loop and the write timer for PV-surplus/room-temperature control run on independent schedules against the same connection, so without this the same class of transaction desync GitHub Issue #105 reported (a write logged as successful, but never actually reaching the device) could reproduce. A `message_spacing` of 50 ms is now set when the connection is built.

#### Tests
- Added a regression test asserting a second heat pump's COP, energy and cycling counters come from its own registers, independent of the first (Issue #107/#93's original symptom).
- Added a regression test combining a counter restart-restore with a changed configured offset in the same run, asserting the offset moves the total by the delta exactly once.
- Added a regression test for an implausibly large single-poll energy jump (above the existing delta ceiling) not being booked, mirroring the existing tests for a negative delta.
- Added a regression test asserting the connection is always built with a nonzero `message_spacing`.
- Strengthened the existing device-info test to assert the coordinator never hands out the deprecated `via_device` kwarg, not just the resulting `via_device_id` value.

### [3.5.0] - 2026-09-06

Adoption of a ground-up rewrite of the integration (PR #115, "fork-takeover"), replacing the `main`-branch 2.8.x codebase's Modbus layer and much of its entity code.

#### Changed
- **Modbus layer**: `pymodbus` and the hand-rolled `modbus_utils.py` wrapper are replaced by [`modbus-connection`](https://github.com/home-assistant-libs/modbus-connection) with the `tmodbus` backend. The register model is now declared declaratively per sub-system (`lambda_modbus/`), rather than as data-driven dictionaries.
- **Multi-heat-pump addressing**: heat pumps (and every other module) are addressed by an integer index and modelled as in-process objects throughout, rather than by reconstructing an `entity_id` string from the device name — the class of bug behind GitHub Issues #93/#107 (a second heat pump's sensors silently wired to the wrong source, or never found) cannot occur in this shape any more.
- **Energy/cycling counter persistence**: counters are plain Home Assistant `RestoreSensor`s with a self-tracked offset baseline; the previous coordinator-owned `cycle_energy_persist.json` file (and the restart/offset-persistence bug class fixed in 2.8.4/2.8.6 on `main`) no longer exists in this shape.
- **Minimum Home Assistant version**: now 2026.9.0 (required by `modbus-connection[tmodbus]`), enforced in `hacs.json`. Earlier Home Assistant versions are not supported by this line.

#### Note
- See [3.5.2](#352---2026-09-06) above for the gaps this audit found and fixed. The [Entwickler documentation](https://guidojeuken-6512.github.io/lambda_heat_pumps/Entwickler/modbus-serialisierung/) covers the new Modbus-serialization design in detail.

### [2.6.0] - 2026-06-24

#### New Features
- **Cooling Circuit Climate Entity**: New `climate.<prefix>_hc<n>_cooling_circuit` entity per detected heating circuit, analogous to the existing `heating_circuit` climate entity. Shares the same current-temperature source (room device temperature) as `heating_circuit`, but writes its setpoint to the dedicated cooling setpoint register (offset 52, e.g. register 5052 for HC1, 5152 for HC2, …). Disabled by default — enable via the new `cooling_mode_enabled` option in the integration's Options Flow.

---

### [2.5.0] - 2026-04-16

Pure code quality and stability release — no breaking changes, no impact on `unique_id`, `entity_id`, or `sensor_id`.

#### Fixed
- **Race condition in reload flag** (K-01): Fast-path now uses `lock.locked()` (atomic) to close a TOCTOU gap in `async_reload_entry()`
- **Background auto-detection exception logging** (K-02, fixes #80): Level raised to `WARNING` with full traceback (`exc_info=True`)
- **Modbus locks bound to wrong event loop** (K-03): Lazy initialization — locks are created on first call, not at module import
- **Entity registry listener without debounce** (H-01): 250 ms debounce prevents redundant parallel mapping updates
- **Non-atomic sensor ID update** (H-02): Local copies + atomic swap eliminates inconsistent intermediate state
- **Persist data lost on shutdown** (H-03): `_persist_counters(force=True)` called on unload to flush within the debounce window
- **Climate state inconsistency on write error** (H-04): Explicit `None` check before local state update; refresh on failure
- **Fragile JSON repair logic** (M-01): Regex-based repair removed; backup-and-reset strategy for corrupted persist files
- **Modbus batch size too close to protocol limit** (M-02): Limit lowered from 120 to 100 registers (safe margin below the 125-register maximum)
- **Missing temperature range validation** (M-03): `min_temp >= max_temp` now falls back to defaults with a warning
- **Persist file missing version field** (M-04): `"version": 1` written to all new persist files

#### Code Quality
- Log levels corrected (`INFO` → `WARNING`/`DEBUG`) for connection errors and health-check results (Q-01)
- ~110 lines of hardcoded INT32 debug code for registers 1020/1022 removed (Q-02)
- Dead-code method `_generate_entity_id()` removed (Q-03)
- Log-prefix constants defined in `__init__.py` (Q-04); inline imports moved to file top (Q-05)

#### Dependencies
- `pymodbus` 3.9.2 → 3.13.0 · `packaging` ≥23.1 → ≥26.0 · `homeassistant` ≥2025.10 → ≥2026.2.3 (test)

---

### [2.4.0] - 2026-03-29
 
#### Fixed
- **Critical: Cycling offset re-applied on every cycle event**: `increment_cycling_counter()` was re-adding the full `cycling_offsets` YAML value on every detected mode change instead of once at startup. Offset logic removed from this function; sole responsibility now lies with `_apply_cycling_offset()` in `sensor.py`, which correctly uses differential tracking.
- **Mode detection for cycling counters**: Fixed shared-state bug that caused cycle events to be missed.
- **NameError in `increment_cycling_counter()`**: Operating mode transitions were detected but never counted due to a `cycling_entity` NameError.
- **Energy offsets silently ignored**: `_apply_energy_offset()` was never called from `async_added_to_hass()`, causing configured energy offsets to have no effect at HA startup.

#### Improvements
- Configuration template (`lambda_wp_config.yaml`) extended with examples for negative offsets and thermal energy offset keys.
- Migration system updated; 23 new tests added covering offset scenarios.
- Documentation updated: negative offset usage documented, stale warning banners removed.

### [2.3.4] - 2026-03-21
Change to the logic for detecting compressor starts (cycling): The 'compressor_unit_rating' sensor is used and is queried more frequently.

### [2.3] - 2026-03-01

> ⚠️ **Before upgrading**: Create a backup of your Home Assistant configuration. This release contains a breaking change that may alter entity IDs under certain conditions.

#### Breaking Changes
- **Name Prefix Normalization**: The configured `name_prefix` is now automatically converted to lowercase with spaces removed. 

#### New Features
- **COP Sensors** (Heating / Cooling / Hot Water): New sensors for the Coefficient of Performance — hourly, daily, monthly, and total periods. Calculated from thermal energy output and electrical consumption.
- **Thermal Energy Consumption Sensors**: Tracks heat output per heat pump — daily, monthly, total, and yesterday. Can optionally use an external heat meter as source sensor via `lambda_wp_config.yaml` (`thermal_sensor_entity_id`).
- **Flow Line Temperature Setpoint Sensor**: New sensor `hp_flow_line_temperature_setpoint` for the calculated flow temperature target value.
- **Compressor Start Cycling Yesterday**: New sensor `compressor_start_cycling_yesterday` for yesterday's compressor start count.

#### Fixed
- **Compressor Start Cycle Counter**: Counter now triggers on HP-State `2` (RESTART-BLOCK) instead of `5` (START COMPRESSOR). RESTART-BLOCK is the lockout state entered after a completed compressor run — counting here means counting completed cycles, not started ones.
- **Entity Duplicate Cleanup**: Sensors with `config_parameter_` in their name were falsely detected as HA duplicates by the `_\d+$` regex (e.g. `config_parameter_24` ends in `_24`). These sensors are now skipped in both cleanup passes.
- **Energy Consistency**: Daily, monthly, and yearly energy values are now validated on restore and reset — a previous-period value can never exceed the current total, preventing negative consumption differences.
- **Reset Sequence**: Yesterday sensors are now updated before the daily counter reset, ensuring `_yesterday` always reflects the actual prior-day value.
- **Energy Calculation**: Daily/monthly/yearly deltas now read baseline values directly from registered HA entities instead of internal variables, avoiding inconsistencies after reloads.
- **Modbus int16 Conversion**: Fixed signed-to-unsigned conversion for 16-bit registers (Two's Complement). New helper `clamp_to_int16` prevents overflow.
- **Room Thermostat Offset**: Corrected configurable offset range and Modbus conversion for signed values.
- **Maximum Boiler Temperature**: Removed from sensor templates — it reads the same Modbus register as `target_high_temperature`.

#### Improvements
- **Internal Refactoring**: `const.py` split into three focused modules (`const_base.py`, `const_sensor.py`, `const_calculated_sensors.py`); per-entry reload locks replacing a single global lock; f-string logging replaced with HA-compliant `%s` format; redundant `_unique_id` attributes removed from sensor classes.

### [1.2.2] - 2025-08-18

#### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE - BACKUP REQUIRED

This release contains significant changes to the Entity Registry and sensor naming conventions. **Please create a complete backup of your Home Assistant configuration before updating.**

**What will change:**
- Automatic migration of existing sensor entities to prevent duplicates
- Updated unique_id format for better consistency
- Sensor filtering based on firmware compatibility

**After migration, please verify:**
- Sensor names and long-term data are preserved correctly
- No duplicate entities exist in your system
- All sensors are functioning as expected
- **Automations may need to be updated** if they reference sensor entities that were migrated

**A Copy of the core.config_entries, core.device_registry and core.entity_registry is created before the sensors are migrated and can be copied back from the /lambda_heat_pumps folder to the hidden .storage folder to undo the changes. However, version 1.0.9 of the integration must then be reinstalled for the system to work properly.**

### [3.5.6] - 2026-09-15

Einen Datenverlust-Bug behoben, der jede Installation beim Upgrade von einer Vor-3.5-Version betrifft — gefunden und verifiziert über einen echten v2.8.x→3.5.x-Upgrade auf realer Hardware.

#### Behoben
- **Lifetime-Gesamtzähler fielen beim v2.8.x→3.5.x-Upgrade auf null (bzw. nur den konfigurierten Offset) zurück**: `LambdaCounterSensor._restored_value()` (`sensor.py`) hat sich ausschließlich auf Home Assistants natives Restore verlassen (`RestoreSensor`-Extradaten, dann der letzte eigene State der Entity). Beim Upgrade werden die Entities der alten Version kurz `unavailable`, während ihr Config-Entry entladen wird — genau der Moment, in dem die neue Version versucht, von ihnen wiederherzustellen — und `float("unavailable")` schlug ohne weiteren Fallback fehl, wodurch jeder `_total`-Zähler (`heating_energy_total`, `heating_thermal_energy_total`, `hot_water_energy_total`, `stby_energy_total` sowie die Zyklus-Zähler-Pendants) stillschweigend wieder bei `0.0` begann. `_restored_value()` greift jetzt zusätzlich auf `homeassistant.components.recorder.statistics.get_last_statistics()` zurück: Da es sich um `state_class: TOTAL`/`TOTAL_INCREASING`-Sensoren handelt, führt Home Assistant für sie ohnehin Langzeitstatistik, ausschließlich aus echten Werten kompiliert — der letzte Eintrag hält weiterhin, was der Zähler tatsächlich war, auch über eine `unavailable`-Lücke im reinen State-Verlauf hinweg.
- **Ein so geretteter Wert konnte den konfigurierten Offset ein zweites Mal aufaddiert bekommen**: `_applied_offset` (wie viel vom konfigurierten `energy_consumption_offsets`/`cycling_offsets` bereits in einem restaurierten Wert steckt) wurde bisher bedingungslos aus dem `applied_offset`-Attribut des letzten States gelesen — das genau wie der State selbst verschwunden ist, wenn dieser State `"unavailable"` war. `async_added_to_hass()` behandelt einen über den neuen Statistik-Fallback geretteten Wert jetzt so, als sei der heute konfigurierte Offset bereits enthalten, sodass `_apply_offset()`s Differenzrechnung auf null kommt, statt den vollen Offset nochmal draufzuaddieren.
- **Ein zweiter, unabhängiger Absturz in derselben Änderung**: `YesterdayCycleSensor` (die `*_cycling_yesterday`-Sensoren) ruft dieselbe `_restored_value()`-Hilfsfunktion auf, ihr Aufrufer war aber nicht auf den neuen Rückgabetyp umgestellt (`_Restored`, der sowohl den Wert als auch trägt, ob die Quelle für das Offset-Attribut vertrauenswürdig ist) — er wies weiterhin das gesamte Objekt `self._value` zu, und das `round()` eines nicht-numerischen Objekts warf bei jeder Wiederherstellung und danach bei jedem weiteren Coordinator-Update `TypeError: type _Restored doesn't define __round__ method`, was den Entity-Aufbau abstürzen ließ und diese fünf Sensoren `unavailable` beließ. Behoben durch Entpacken von `.value`, wie beim anderen Aufrufer.
- `manifest.json`: `after_dependencies: ["recorder"]` ergänzt (weiche Abhängigkeit — die Plattform startet nach `recorder`, falls vorhanden, ohne es vorauszusetzen).

#### Tests
- Neuer Test `tests/test_migration_restore.py::test_a_restart_from_unavailable_restores_from_statistics`: nutzt die `recorder_mock`-Fixture von `pytest_homeassistant_custom_component` plus `async_import_statistics()`, um den genauen Fehlerfall nachzustellen — ein simulierter `"unavailable"`-letzter-State ohne `RestoreSensor`-Extradaten, und eine Langzeitstatistik mit dem echten vorherigen Wert plus einem konfigurierten Offset — und prüft, dass der Zähler diesen Wert mit genau einmal angewendetem Offset restauriert. In eigener Datei belassen: `recorder_mock` muss in diesem Test-Harness vor `hass` aufgelöst werden, was mit dem modulweiten `enable_custom_integrations`-Mark der anderen Testdateien kollidiert.
- Neuer Test `tests/test_counters.py::test_yesterday_survives_a_restart`, deckt den zweiten Bug direkt ab (ein einfacher restaurierter State, kein Recorder nötig) — reproduziert den `TypeError` vor dem Fix und läuft danach grün.
- Volle Suite: 146/146 grün.
- **Gegen echte Hardware verifiziert** (Installation `.115`, Firmware `V0.0.9-3K`, Upgrade von v2.8.x): vollständigen Vorher/Nachher-Abzug aller 177 `lambda_heat_pumps`-Entities über die ha-mcp-API gezogen. Jeder Lifetime- und Zyklus-Zähler (`heating_energy_total`, `heating_thermal_energy_total`, `hot_water_energy_total`, `stby_energy_total` sowie alle fünf Zyklus-Totals, fünf davon mit echten konfigurierten Offsets zwischen 3,1 und 1500) hat den echten Upgrade mit exakt seinem vorherigen Wert und genau einmal angewendetem Offset überstanden. Der `_cycling_yesterday`-Absturz wurde zuerst live reproduziert (bestätigt die Log-Signatur oben), dann durch Redeploy des Fixes und erneuten Neustart behoben — diesmal keine Regression, und die fünf zuvor abstürzenden Sensoren liefen danach wieder sauber.

### [3.5.4] - 2026-09-09

Eine weitere Home-Assistant-Deprecation-Warnung behoben, gefunden bei der Auswertung der echten System-Logs zweier laufender Installationen nach einem Update auf Home Assistant 2026.9.1.

#### Behoben
- **`device_registry.async_get_device()` ist deprecated und wird in Home Assistant 2027.8.0 entfernt**: `LambdaCoordinator.device_info()` nutzte den Identifiers-Set-Lookup (`async_get_device(identifiers={controller})`), um das Controller-Gerät zu finden und `via_device_id` eines Untergeräts zu setzen. Home Assistant 2026.9 warnt, dass Geräte-Identifier nicht mehr über Config-Entries hinweg eindeutig garantiert sind, und verweist stattdessen auf `async_get_device_by_identifier()`, `async_get_device_by_connection()` oder `async_get_devices()`. Umgestellt auf `async_get_device_by_identifier(controller, entry.entry_id)`, was den Lookup auf diesen Config-Entry eingrenzt und damit nicht mehrdeutig sein kann — derselbe Fix aus demselben Grund wie die in 3.5.2 behobene `via_device`-Deprecation.

#### Tests
- Gegen echte Hardware auf beiden laufenden Installationen verifiziert: Die volle Testsuite (143 Tests) läuft unverändert durch; ein Live-Entfernen-und-Neuanlegen des Config-Entry (Entry, Geräte und Entities aus der Storage löschen, neu starten, Entry neu anlegen, erneut neu starten) reproduziert exakt dieselben 156 Entities auf 4 Geräten, mit korrekt aufgelöster `via_device_id` bei allen drei Untergeräten; und ein vollständiger End-to-End-Durchlauf des echten Config-Flows (`async_step_user` → `async_can_connect` → `async_create_entry` → `async_setup_entry`, inklusive echter automatischer Modul-Erkennung) gegen den echten Controller registriert dieselben 156 Entities und hinterlässt den Entry im Zustand `LOADED`.

### [3.5.3] - 2026-09-06

Eine Funktionsregression aus 3.5.0 behoben, gefunden beim Live-Test gegen echte Hardware: jeder Modbus-Schreibvorgang nutzte den falschen Funktionscode.

#### Behoben
- **Jeder Modbus-Schreibvorgang nutzte für ein einzelnes Register FC06 (Write Single Register); Lambdas eigene Modbus-Dokumentation schreibt für jeden Schreibvorgang FC16 (Write Multiple Registers) vor und implementiert FC06 überhaupt nicht** — FC06 wird mit Illegal Function (Exception 0x01) beantwortet. Dadurch scheiterte, je nach Pfad protokolliert oder still, jede schreibende Funktion: die Raumthermostat-Steuerung (Register 5004, protokolliert alle ~9s), der PV-Überschuss-Export, die Warmwasser-/Heizkreis-/Kühlkreis-Sollwerte, der Vorlauf-Offset sowie der generische `write_modbus_register`-Service. Der Vor-3.5-Code auf Basis von `pymodbus` hatte dieses Problem nie, da er ausnahmslos über `write_registers()` (FC16) schrieb, auch für ein einzelnes Register. Jedes `writable=True`-Feld in `lambda_modbus/` setzt jetzt `force_fc16=True` (ein von `modbus-connection` genau für diesen Fall vorgesehenes Flag), und die beiden Stellen mit direktem Schreibzugriff (PV-Überschuss-Writer und der generische Register-Schreib-Service in `services.py`) rufen jetzt `write_registers()` statt `write_register()` auf.
- Live gegen echte Hardware verifiziert (Firmware `V0.0.8-3K`): Der Raumtemperatur-Schreibzugriff (Register 5004) sowie eine Warmwasser-Sollwertänderung über `climate.set_temperature` kamen nach dem Fix korrekt an; zuvor scheiterten beide mit `Modbus Exception 0x01 for function code 0x06`.

#### Hinweis
- Im aktuellen Modell existiert kein `PackedBitsField`/Bit-Feld-Register, daher greift der eine FC06-Sonderpfad innerhalb von `modbus-connection`s `write_register_field()` (für Read-Modify-Write gepackter Bit-Register, ignoriert `force_fc16`) hier nie.

### [3.5.2] - 2026-09-06

Nachzieharbeiten zu 3.5.0: drei Lücken, gefunden bei der Prüfung aller 2.7.x/2.8.x-Bugfixes des Vor-Rewrite-Branches `main` gegen den neu geschriebenen Code — ob sie dort noch galten.

#### Behoben
- **`via_device`-Deprecation-Warnung bei Sub-Geräten**: `LambdaCoordinator.device_info()` übergab bei Sub-Geräten weiterhin das veraltete `via_device` (Identifiers-Tupel), was bei jedem Setup eine Home-Assistant-Entfernungswarnung protokollierte (Entfernung angekündigt für 2027.8.0). Da 3.x durchgängig Home Assistant ≥ 2026.9 voraussetzt, wird jetzt immer `via_device_id` (die Registry-ID des übergeordneten Geräts) aufgelöst und gesetzt — anders als beim 2.8.5-Fix auf `main` ist dafür keine Versions-Weiche nötig.
- **0xFFFF ("keine Anforderung"/"kein externer Sensor") als echter Wert gelesen**: Die Außentemperatur (ohne eingespeisten externen Fühler) und die Anforderungsregister eines Puffers (ohne aktive Anforderung) melden `0xFFFF` (-1) statt eines Messwerts — skaliert sah das wie ein plausibler Wert aus (exakt -300,0 °C) statt `unknown`. Dieser Sonderwert wird jetzt bei den betroffenen Feldern gefiltert (`Ambient.temperature`, `Buffer.request_type`/`request_flow_line_temp_setpoint`/`request_return_line_temp_setpoint`/`request_heat_sink_temp_diff_setpoint`/`modbus_request_heating_capacity`, `HeatingCircuit.operating_mode`) — die globale Sentinel-Filterung blieb unverändert, da -1 bei anderen Registern (z. B. Temperatur-Offsets) ein gültiger Wert ist.
- **Modbus-Lese-/Schreibvorgänge wurden nicht tatsächlich serialisiert**: Der eigene Anfrage-Pacing-Lock von `modbus-connection` greift nur, wenn der Verbindung ein `message_spacing`/`unit_spacing` größer als 0 mitgegeben wird — ohne das (dem Standard) ist er wirkungslos. Poll-Loop und der Schreib-Timer für PV-Überschuss-/Raumtemperatur-Steuerung laufen mit unabhängigen Intervallen auf derselben Verbindung; ohne diesen Fix konnte dieselbe Fehlerklasse wie in GitHub Issue #105 beschrieben (ein Schreibvorgang wird als erfolgreich geloggt, kommt am Gerät aber nie an) erneut auftreten. Beim Verbindungsaufbau wird jetzt ein `message_spacing` von 50 ms gesetzt.

#### Tests
- Regressionstest ergänzt: die COP-, Energie- und Zyklus-Zähler einer zweiten Wärmepumpe stammen aus ihren eigenen Registern, unabhängig von der ersten (ursprüngliches Symptom von Issue #107/#93).
- Regressionstest ergänzt: Neustart-Restore eines Zählers kombiniert mit einem geänderten konfigurierten Offset im selben Lauf — der Offset verschiebt den Gesamtwert exakt einmal um die Differenz.
- Regressionstest ergänzt: ein unplausibel großer Sprung eines Energiezählers in einem Poll (über der bestehenden Delta-Obergrenze) wird nicht verbucht, analog zu den bestehenden Tests für einen negativen Delta.
- Regressionstest ergänzt: die Verbindung wird immer mit einem `message_spacing` größer 0 aufgebaut.
- Bestehenden Device-Info-Test verschärft: prüft jetzt, dass der Coordinator nie das veraltete `via_device`-Kwarg übergibt, nicht nur das resultierende `via_device_id`.

### [3.5.0] - 2026-09-06

Übernahme eines von Grund auf neu geschriebenen Codes für die Integration (PR #115, „fork-takeover"), der die Modbus-Schicht und einen Großteil des Entity-Codes der `main`-2.8.x-Codebasis ersetzt.

#### Geändert
- **Modbus-Schicht**: `pymodbus` und der handgeschriebene `modbus_utils.py`-Wrapper werden durch [`modbus-connection`](https://github.com/home-assistant-libs/modbus-connection) mit dem `tmodbus`-Backend ersetzt. Das Registermodell wird jetzt je Teilsystem deklarativ beschrieben (`lambda_modbus/`), statt als datengetriebene Dictionaries.
- **Adressierung mehrerer Wärmepumpen**: Wärmepumpen (und jedes andere Modul) werden durchgehend über einen Integer-Index adressiert und als In-Process-Objekte modelliert, statt eine `entity_id` aus dem Gerätenamen zu rekonstruieren — die Fehlerklasse hinter den GitHub Issues #93/#107 (Sensoren einer zweiten Wärmepumpe wurden still auf die falsche Quelle verdrahtet oder gar nicht gefunden) kann in dieser Form nicht mehr auftreten.
- **Persistenz der Energie-/Zyklus-Zähler**: Zähler sind jetzt normale Home-Assistant-`RestoreSensor`s mit einer selbst nachgeführten Offset-Basislinie; die bisherige, vom Coordinator verwaltete Datei `cycle_energy_persist.json` (und die dort auf `main` in 2.8.4/2.8.6 behobene Fehlerklasse bei Neustart/Offset-Persistenz) existiert in dieser Form nicht mehr.
- **Mindest-Home-Assistant-Version**: jetzt 2026.9.0 (vorausgesetzt von `modbus-connection[tmodbus]`), durchgesetzt in `hacs.json`. Ältere Home-Assistant-Versionen werden von dieser Linie nicht mehr unterstützt.

#### Hinweis
- Die bei dieser Prüfung gefundenen und behobenen Lücken siehe [3.5.2](#352---2026-09-06) oben. Die [Entwickler-Dokumentation](https://guidojeuken-6512.github.io/lambda_heat_pumps/Entwickler/modbus-serialisierung/) beschreibt das neue Modbus-Serialisierungs-Design im Detail.

### [2.6.0] - 2026-06-24

#### Neue Funktionen
- **Kühlkreis-Climate-Entity**: Neue Entity `climate.<prefix>_hc<n>_cooling_circuit` je erkanntem Heizkreis, analog zur bestehenden `heating_circuit`-Climate-Entity. Nutzt dieselbe Quelle für die Ist-Temperatur (Raum-Gerätetemperatur) wie `heating_circuit`, schreibt den Sollwert aber auf das dedizierte Kühl-Sollwert-Register (Offset 52, z. B. Register 5052 für HC1, 5152 für HC2, …). Standardmäßig deaktiviert — Aktivierung über die neue Option `cooling_mode_enabled` im Options-Flow der Integration.

---

### [2.5.0] - 2026-04-16

Reines Code-Qualitäts- und Stabilitätsrelease — keine Breaking Changes, keine Auswirkung auf `unique_id`, `entity_id` oder `sensor_id`.

#### Behoben
- **Race Condition im Reload-Flag** (K-01): Fast-Path verwendet jetzt `lock.locked()` (atomar) — TOCTOU-Lücke in `async_reload_entry()` geschlossen
- **Exception-Logging im Auto-Detection-Task** (K-02, behebt #80): Log-Level auf `WARNING` + `exc_info=True` für vollständigen Traceback angehoben
- **Modbus-Locks an falschen Event-Loop gebunden** (K-03): Lazy-Initialization — Locks werden erst beim ersten Aufruf erstellt, nicht mehr beim Modul-Import
- **Entity-Registry-Listener ohne Debounce** (H-01): 250 ms Debounce verhindert redundante parallele Mapping-Updates
- **Nicht-atomares Sensor-ID-Update** (H-02): Lokale Kopien + atomarer Tausch eliminieren inkonsistente Zwischenzustände
- **Persist-Datenverlust beim Shutdown** (H-03): `_persist_counters(force=True)` beim Unload flusht Daten innerhalb des Debounce-Fensters
- **Climate State-Inkonsistenz bei Write-Fehler** (H-04): Explizite `None`-Prüfung vor lokalem State-Update; Refresh bei Fehler
- **Fragile JSON-Repair-Logik** (M-01): Regex-Reparatur entfernt; Backup-und-Reset-Strategie bei korrupten Persist-Dateien
- **Modbus-Batch-Größe zu nah am Protokoll-Limit** (M-02): Limit von 120 auf 100 Register gesenkt (sicherer Puffer unter dem Maximum von 125)
- **Fehlende Temperaturbereich-Validierung** (M-03): `min_temp >= max_temp` wird erkannt und mit Warnung auf Defaults zurückgefallen
- **Fehlendes Versionsfeld in der Persist-Datei** (M-04): `"version": 1` wird in alle neuen Persist-Dateien geschrieben

#### Code-Qualität
- Log-Level in `modbus_utils.py` und `coordinator.py` korrigiert (`INFO` → `WARNING`/`DEBUG`) (Q-01)
- ~110 Zeilen hardcodierter INT32-Debug-Code für Register 1020/1022 entfernt (Q-02)
- Dead-Code-Methode `_generate_entity_id()` entfernt (Q-03)
- Log-Präfix-Konstanten in `__init__.py` definiert (Q-04); Inline-Imports an Dateianfang verschoben (Q-05)

#### Abhängigkeiten
- `pymodbus` 3.9.2 → 3.13.0 · `packaging` ≥23.1 → ≥26.0 · `homeassistant` ≥2025.10 → ≥2026.2.3 (Test)

---

### [2.4.0] - 2026-03-29

#### Behoben
- **Kritisch: Cycling-Offset wurde bei jedem Zyklus erneut addiert**: `increment_cycling_counter()` hat den in `lambda_wp_config.yaml` konfigurierten `cycling_offsets`-Wert bei jeder erkannten Modusänderung neu aufaddiert statt einmalig beim Start. Die Offset-Logik wurde aus dieser Funktion entfernt; alleinige Verantwortung liegt jetzt bei `_apply_cycling_offset()` in `sensor.py`, das korrekt mit Differenz-Tracking arbeitet.
- **Moduserkennung für Cycling-Zähler**: Fehler durch gemeinsam genutzten Zustand behoben, der dazu führte, dass Zyklusereignisse nicht erkannt wurden.
- **NameError in `increment_cycling_counter()`**: Betriebsmodus-Übergänge wurden zwar erkannt, aber wegen eines `cycling_entity`-NameErrors nie gezählt.
- **Energie-Offsets wurden lautlos ignoriert**: `_apply_energy_offset()` wurde nicht aus `async_added_to_hass()` aufgerufen, sodass konfigurierte Energie-Offsets beim HA-Start keine Wirkung hatten.

#### Verbesserungen
- Konfigurations-Template (`lambda_wp_config.yaml`) um Beispiele für negative Offsets und thermische Energie-Offset-Schlüssel erweitert.
- Migrationssystem aktualisiert; 23 neue Tests für Offset-Szenarien hinzugefügt.
- Dokumentation aktualisiert: Verwendung negativer Offsets dokumentiert, veraltete Warnhinweise entfernt.

---

### [2.3.4] - 2026-03-21
Änderung an der Logik zur Erkennung von Kompressorstarts (Cycling): Der Sensor `compressor_unit_rating` wird verwendet und häufiger abgefragt.

---

### [2.3] - 2026-XX-XX

> ⚠️ **Vor dem Update**: Erstelle ein Backup deiner Home Assistant Konfiguration (Verzeichnis `config/`) sowie der `lambda_wp_config.yaml`. Dieses Release enthält einen Breaking Change, der Entity-IDs verändern kann.

#### Breaking Changes
- **Name-Prefix-Normalisierung**: Der konfigurierte `name_prefix` wird ab sofort automatisch in Kleinbuchstaben umgewandelt und Leerzeichen werden entfernt. Wer einen Prefix mit Großbuchstaben oder Leerzeichen verwendet hatte (z. B. `"EU08L"` oder `"Lambda WP"`), bekommt geänderte Entity-IDs — bestehende Automationen, Dashboards und Template-Sensoren müssen angepasst werden.

#### Neue Funktionen
- **COP-Sensoren** (Heizen / Kühlen / Warmwasser): Neue Sensoren für die Arbeitszahl — stündlich, täglich, monatlich und gesamt. Berechnung aus thermischem Energieertrag und elektrischem Verbrauch.
- **Thermische Energieverbrauchs-Sensoren**: Tracking der Wärmeabgabe pro Wärmepumpe — täglich, monatlich, gesamt und gestern. Optional kann ein externer Wärmemengenzähler als Quellsensor konfiguriert werden (`thermal_sensor_entity_id` in `lambda_wp_config.yaml`).
- **Vorlauftemperatur-Sollwert-Sensor**: Neuer Sensor `hp_flow_line_temperature_setpoint` für den berechneten Vorlauf-Sollwert.
- **Kompressorstarts Gestern**: Neuer Sensor `compressor_start_cycling_yesterday` für die Kompressorstarts des Vortags.

#### Behoben
- **Kompressorstart-Zähler**: Der Zähler löst jetzt bei HP-State `2` (RESTART-BLOCK) statt bei `5` (START COMPRESSOR) aus. RESTART-BLOCK ist der Sperrzeit-Zustand nach einem abgeschlossenen Kompressorlauf — damit werden abgeschlossene Zyklen gezählt, nicht gestartete.
- **Duplikat-Cleanup**: Sensoren mit `config_parameter_` im Namen wurden vom Regex `_\d+$` fälschlicherweise als HA-Duplikate erkannt (z. B. endet `config_parameter_24` auf `_24`). Diese Sensoren werden jetzt in beiden Cleanup-Phasen übersprungen.
- **Energie-Konsistenz**: Tages-, Monats- und Jahreswerte werden beim Restore und Reset geprüft — ein Vorperiodenwert kann den aktuellen Gesamtwert nicht übersteigen, damit keine negativen Differenzen entstehen.
- **Reset-Reihenfolge**: Gestern-Sensoren werden jetzt vor dem täglichen Reset aktualisiert, sodass `_yesterday` immer dem tatsächlichen Vortageswert entspricht.
- **Energieberechnung**: Differenzwerte werden jetzt direkt aus den HA-Entities gelesen statt aus internen Variablen — verhindert Inkonsistenzen nach Reloads.
- **Modbus int16-Konvertierung**: Korrektur der Vorzeichen-Konvertierung für 16-Bit-Register (Two's Complement). Neue Hilfsfunktion `clamp_to_int16` verhindert Überlauf.
- **Raumthermostat-Offset**: Offset-Bereich und Modbus-Konvertierung für vorzeichenbehaftete Werte korrigiert.
- **Maximum Boiler Temperature**: Aus den Sensor-Templates entfernt — liest dasselbe Modbus-Register wie `target_high_temperature`.

#### Verbesserungen
- **Internes Refactoring**: `const.py` in drei Module aufgeteilt (`const_base.py`, `const_sensor.py`, `const_calculated_sensors.py`); pro-Entry-Reload-Locks ersetzen eine globale Sperre; f-String-Logging durch HA-konformes `%s`-Format ersetzt; redundante `_unique_id`-Attribute aus Sensor-Klassen entfernt.

---

### [2.0.1] - 2025-01-XX

  - Erscheint in der Geräte-Konfiguration neben den Heizkurven-Stützpunkten
  - Modbus-Register: Register 50 (relativ zur Base-Adresse des Heizkreises)

#### Behoben
- **Heizkurven-Validierung**: Validierungslogik korrigiert, um beide Bedingungen unabhängig zu prüfen
  - `elif` zu `if` geändert, um sicherzustellen, dass beide Validierungsprüfungen durchgeführt werden
  - Meldet jetzt alle Validierungsprobleme, wenn mehrere Heizkurven-Werte falsch konfiguriert sind
  - Zuvor wurde nur das erste Problem gemeldet, wenn alle drei Temperaturpunkte in falscher Reihenfolge waren
  - Behoben: Problem wenn alle drei Heizkurven-Punkte identische Werte haben (Issue #48)

- **Eco-Modus in Heizkurve**: Hinzugefügte Eco-Temperaturreduktion für Heizkreise (Issue #51)
  - Neue Number-Entity `eco_temp_reduction` pro Heizkreis mit Bereich -10,0 bis 0,0°C (Standard: -1,0°C)
  - Reduziert automatisch die berechnete Vorlauftemperatur, wenn der Heizkreis im ECO-Modus ist (operating_state = 1)
  - In die Heizkurven-Berechnung integriert, zusammen mit Vorlauf-Offset und Raumthermostat-Anpassungen


### [2.0.0] - 2025-01-XX

#### Neue Funktionen
- **Geräte-Hierarchie**: Implementierte Aufteilung in Haupt- und Sub-Geräte für bessere Organisation und klarere Entity-Struktur

  - **Warmer Punkt**: Definiert die Heizkurve bei hohen Außentemperaturen
  - **Neuer Sensor**: `heating_curve_flow_line_temperature_calc` berechnet automatisch die optimale Vorlauftemperatur basierend auf aktueller Außentemperatur und den konfigurierten Stützpunkten
- **Kompressor-Start Cycling Sensor**: Hinzugefügter neuer Cycling-Sensor zur Verfolgung von Kompressor-Start-Ereignissen
  - **Total-Sensor**: `compressor_start_cycling_total` - Verfolgt Gesamtanzahl der Kompressor-Starts seit Installation
  - **Daily-Sensor**: `compressor_start_cycling_daily` - Verfolgt tägliche Kompressor-Starts (Reset um Mitternacht)
  - **2H-Sensor**: `compressor_start_cycling_2h` - Verfolgt 2-Stunden Kompressor-Starts (Reset alle 2 Stunden)
  - **4H-Sensor**: `compressor_start_cycling_4h` - Verfolgt 4-Stunden Kompressor-Starts (Reset alle 4 Stunden)
  - **Monthly-Sensor**: `compressor_start_cycling_monthly` - Verfolgt monatliche Kompressor-Starts (Reset am 1. des Monats)
  - **Flankenerkennung**: Verwendet HP_STATE Register (1002) statt HP_OPERATING_STATE, erkennt "START COMPRESSOR" Status (Wert 5)

#### Verbesserungen
- Verbesserte Entity-Namensgebung mit ordnungsgemäßen Geräte- und Sub-Geräte-Präfixen

### [1.2.2] - 2025-08-18

#### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES IN DIESER VERSION - BACKUP ERFORDERLICH

Diese Version enthält wesentliche Änderungen an der Entity Registry und den Sensor-Namenskonventionen. **Bitte erstellen Sie ein vollständiges Backup Ihrer Home Assistant-Konfiguration vor dem Update.**

**Was sich ändern wird:**
- Automatische Migration bestehender Sensor-Entities zur Vermeidung von Duplikaten
- Aktualisiertes unique_id-Format für bessere Konsistenz
- Sensor-Filterung basierend auf Firmware-Kompatibilität

**Nach der Migration bitte überprüfen:**
- Sensor-Namen und Langzeitdaten sind korrekt erhalten
- Keine doppelten Entities in Ihrem System vorhanden
- Alle Sensoren funktionieren wie erwartet
- **Automatisierungen müssen möglicherweise aktualisiert werden**, wenn sie auf migrierte Sensor-Entities verweisen

**Eine Kopie der core.config_entries, core.device_registry und core.entity_registry wird vor der Sensor-Migration erstellt und kann aus dem /lambda_heat_pumps-Ordner in den versteckten .storage-Ordner kopiert werden, um die Änderungen rückgängig zu machen. Allerdings muss dann Version 1.0.9 der Integration neu installiert werden, damit das System ordnungsgemäß funktioniert.**
